## Reflection / Background

I've been coding on and off for a few years now, progressively improving each time I dive in. I absolutely love coding, but I do regret giving up in the past. Work was exceptionally slow today, with no tickets to handle. However, today turned out to be one of the best days at work I've had in a long time.

It took me roughly a few hours to complete this project, with some interaction with co-workers and stakeholders. Having music playing in the background and a Figma file to refer to made the process truly enjoyable. Figuring out the logic for the buttons and overall functionality was challenging but rewarding.

I am extremely happy and proud of myself for putting this project together, with about 95% of the work done solo. The remaining 5% of assistance came from ChatGPT, which helped me figure out the functionality for the timer. I had no idea about `setInterval` or `clearInterval` before this project, so I plan to experiment more with timers for better understanding.

If you have any recommendations, critiques, or kudos, I would love to hear from you. I can't wait to learn more, build more, and possibly pursue coding full-time!

**Edit:** After the kids went to bed, I wanted to tinker a bit more on this project as I am really enjoying myself. I tightened up my media query a bit (still not in love with the 'mobile' design...) and added the functionality of "winning-team".
